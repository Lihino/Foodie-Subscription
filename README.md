##Tools Used
SQL (PostgreSQL syntax)

DBMS/Platform: MYSQL

Data Visualization/Reporting: Optional (e.g., Power BI, Excel, Tableau – not used here but recommended for next steps)

##Dataset Description
Table: subscriptions

###Column Description
customer_id	Unique identifier for each customer
plan	Subscription plan (free_trial, basic, pro, ultimate, churn)

Table: plans

###Column Description

##Business Questions Answered
1. New Customers Per Month
Analyzed customer acquisition trends monthly.

Insight: Helps identify marketing and growth effectiveness.

2. Revenue by Plan Type
Calculated revenue generated by each plan based on subscriptions and plan price.

Insight: Identified which plans drive the most revenue.

3. Monthly Revenue
Tracked month-by-month revenue for strategic planning.

Insight: Reveals seasonal trends or growth over time.

4. Plan Migration Analysis
Traced how users transitioned from free_trial to basic, pro, or ultimate.

Insight: Helps optimize plan features and upselling strategy.

5. Churn Analysis
Identified customers who churned and from which plans.

Insight: Helps understand where customer drop-off is most common.

6. Churn Rate Per Plan
Percentage of users who churned relative to those who joined each plan.

Insight: Pinpoints problematic plans needing improvement.

7. Retention Analysis
Measured how long users stay active after signing up.

Insight: Measures customer lifetime engagement.

8. Upgrade Funnel
Modeled how many customers advanced from trial → basic → pro/ultimate.

Insight: A clear view of conversion efficiency.

9. Time to Upgrade or Churn
Calculated the number of days taken to upgrade or churn from initial trial.

Insight: Helps in understanding user decision timelines.

##Key Findings
A significant number of customers start with the free trial, but only a portion upgrade to pro or ultimate.

The basic plan may act as a bottleneck or necessary transition phase.

The ultimate plan, while pricier, contributes significantly to overall revenue.

Churn rates are highest from the basic plan.

Most upgrades or churns happen within the first 30–60 days of a customer's journey.

##Recommended Next Steps
Dashboard Creation: Build interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to visualize:

Monthly customer growth

Churn and retention trends

Plan-wise revenue breakdown

Conversion funnel

Segmentation Analysis: Add customer demographics or geography (if available) to segment and personalize marketing strategies.

Predictive Modeling: Use historical plan transitions to predict potential churn or upgrade probability.

AB Testing Suggestion: Test new pricing or trial features on a subset of customers to improve upgrade rates.
